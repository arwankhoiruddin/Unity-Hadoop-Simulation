Hadoop is a well-known tool that may be used to analyze large amounts of data. I am modeling Hadoop in this repository using Unity in order to get a visual representation of what happens in the HDFS and MapReduce stages. Additionally, we will have the ability to examine, in a graphical format, how the block placement strategy and scheduling effect Hadoop's overall performance.

I make extensive use of script in Unity, which allows me to make the simulation more dynamic. Since I am a huge fan of Java, I also like C#. All scripts in this repository is written in C#.
